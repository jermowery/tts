  Which is how, thirty minutes later, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> finds himself on his
  knees under the table he did indeed clear off. His
  hands are box-tied behind his back with a lovely length of rope and the air is humid under Yennefer's skirt, and he
  mouths hungrily at her through her knickers.

  Yennefer hums quietly, twitching a little when he sucks at her clit with the cotton sticking to his tongue. Her
  fingers barely stutter over the keys above him.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> is under strict instructions, of course.

  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's</phoneme> cock throbs against the cage she locked him in. Fuck, it
  hurts
  <break strength="medium" />he wants to get hard, wants to <prosody rate="slow" pitch="-2st">COME</prosody>
  <break strength="medium" />

  Wants to look at himself, bound and leaking.

  , she'd cooed. But if he moves too much, she'll get cross.
  <emphasis level="strong">Again.</emphasis>

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> moves away from her clit and nuzzles at her inner thigh
  instead, suckling a little on a soft patch of skin. He
  can smell how hot she's getting for it, feel it soaking through her knickers when he noses at the sweet wrapping of
  her cunt.

  It's excruciating, having nowhere to go. If he could eat her out, make her come
  <break strength="medium" />

  But she said not to distract her. Maybe if he does it slowly
  <break strength="medium" />if he teases enough, she'll let him taste her. He's never
  made her come with just his mouth before.

  Time drags on. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> can't say how much of it; he's never had an
  internal sense of it, and his world is currently
  blissfully, unbearably small. At least she tied his hands in a comfortable position.

  Eventually, Yennefer reaches down and drags her nails across<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's
  </phoneme>cheek. She digs in a little, the pricking
  sensation making his poor cock twitch ineffectually again, and then
  <break strength="medium" />then shimmies out of her knickers and drops them
  to the ground.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's</phoneme>breath stills in a reverent hush.

  Yennefer goes back to typing.

  Tentatively, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> leans forward again and kisses a delicate line
  from knee upwards. She shifts a little
  <break strength="weak" />her bare
  feet shuffling against the floor, spreading her legs, and he tucks a little smile into the crease of her thigh.

  Then he nuzzles at her lips, feeling the hair prickle at him in sharp counterpoint to the rest of her soft skin.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> goes slowly; he has the time. Kisses chastely at her, the
  barest hint of shine smearing against his lips. He
  reaches her clit and presses his mouth there too
  <break strength="weak" />tasting her with a kitten lick that makes the chair creak when she
  shifts her weight.

  Can't make too much noise
  <break strength="weak" />but <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> chuckles a little, unable to
  help it. She digs her toes into the side of his
  bare thigh.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> presses with the flat of his tongue instead
  <break strength="weak" />sets a languid
  rhythm like he paces his breathing before a show.
  <prosody rate="slow"> Up, down, the puff of his own warm breath.
    <break strength="weak" /> Up, down, the throb of his cock trying to swell.</prosody>

  His knees <prosody rate="slow">ache</prosody>.

  He swirls his tongue, narrowing the contact and earning another warning against his thigh. The shift of her foot pulls
  at his leg hair, drawing his focus.

  Yennefer stops typing for a moment, but he can hear her clicking the trackpad on her laptop.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> licks at her clit again, wondering how far he can push. Can
  he suck on it gently, drool escaping the corners
  of his mouth because he can't pull himself away? Can he slip his tongue down and lap greedily at the folds of her?

  Yennefer's phone buzzes on the table.

  She answers it.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "I'm looking at your email,"
  </voice>
  she says.
  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> moves to sit back on
  his haunches and she fists a hand in his hair to
  drag him forward again.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "Well, did you go to his office?"
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's</phoneme>eyes flutter shut. He follows the guide of her hand and
  gets back to work.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    <prosody volume="loud">
      "Then get me a line,"
    </prosody>
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />
  Yennefer says impatiently.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> presses his tongue inside gently
  <break strength="weak" />just barely entering the
  heat of her. She tightens her fingers in his hair
  and doesn't pull him away.

  It's quiet for a moment.
  <break strength="medium" />

  Then Yennefer's nails dig into<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's</phoneme>scalp as she says,
  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    <prosody pitch="low">
      "Listen
      carefully, you caterpillar-eyebrowed piece of
      shit. No amount of performative arseholery at your granddaughter's birthday will compensate for your past thirty
      years
      of politically-sanctioned misogyny, so you're going to be at the fucking committee, and you're going to flip like
      a
      fucking pancake, because if you don't,
      <break strength="weak" />
      <prosody volume="loud">fucking help me</prosody>
      <break strength="weak" />, I am going to destroy you."
    </prosody>
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />

  <emphasis>I'm in love with you</emphasis>, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> thinks
  deliriously.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> shifts, working his tongue almost soothingly. Not enough to
  break her concentration, but
  <break strength="weak" />to take the edge off,
  maybe, every part of her tight with fury.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "That's a cute word for it,"
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />
  Yennefer snarks. She pauses.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "Because otherwise I'll rip out the entire bloody clause and
    get the votes from someone else."
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> curls his tongue; her foot slides up his thigh.

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "Try me,
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />
  Yennefer says coolly, and her phone clacks against the table.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> slumps a little, resting the burn in his abdominals from
  staying upright, but he keeps his mouth against her
  cunt.

  Yennefer's fingers loosen in his hair, petting thoughtfully for half a moment, and then she releases him entirely and
  goes back to typing.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> briefly considers the possibility of a nap. He probably
  couldn't fully sleep, but her thigh is soft and steady
  against his cheek and he can feel himself growing sore.

  He nuzzles half-heartedly against her cunt, gauging the reaction.

  The side of her foot tickles up his ribs.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> twitches reflexively and renews his efforts with measured
  enthusiasm; he settles back into the process of it,
  content to let his mind drift through the moments. The sound of Yennefer's typing is a pleasant backdrop, and every
  now and then he'll be rewarded with a little hitch of breath or the nudge of her foot.

  It becomes easier to ignore his own discomfort
  <break strength="weak" />his cock, the bruises forming on his knees. He listens for her fingers
  faltering over the keys when he drags his tongue up to her clit, feels her thighs begin to shake and close around his
  ears. These are the things that matter.

  An immeasurable stretch later, she takes another phone call. He can barely follow the conversation
  <break strength="weak" />doesn't try very
  hard
  <break strength="weak" />but it goes the way she wants it to. Nearly everything does, after all.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> pleasures her through it, keeps going after she's hung up and
  sent off a flurry of correspondence. He
  struggles to breathe quietly, going restless with the instinct to pull away
  <break strength="weak" />it's dizzying, he's so close
  <break strength="weak" />

  Yennefer hisses,
  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    <prosody volume="soft" rate="slow">
      "Fuck."
    </prosody>
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />
  There's a thud—her laptop closing?
  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    <prosody volume="soft">
      "Finish it, if you're going to."
    </prosody>
  </voice>
  <break strength="medium" />

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> sobs eagerly. His tongue is already aching, his mouth and
  chin drenched in her, and he sways drunkenly in his
  rush to ruin himself further.

  She saves him with a sharp hand in his hair, hauling him back where he belongs. He whines gratefully and fucks his
  tongue into her in earnest, offering up all he has left.

  Yennefer gasps; her hips slip forward, smothering him in her cunt. She's so quiet, comparatively. Little gasps and
  half-formed words like she's the one who can't breathe, like he's unravelling her.

  She slumps forward, bracing herself against the table. He makes a needy sound, his chest heaving. A leg wraps around
  his waist
  <break strength="weak" />heel to the small of his back below his bound hands, locking him in place.

  Yennefer keens when she comes
  <break strength="weak" />a sharp, aborted sound that borders on pained. A further shifting of her weight sends
  the chair scraping backwards, suddenly freeing <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> from beneath
  her skirt and casting him unwillingly into the
  light.

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> blinks. His dazed expression is met by her bewildered,
  panting gaze.

  The silence stretches between them.<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜːz">Jaskier's</phoneme>cock strains against its
  cage; her hair is half-loose from its braid.

  Unbearably, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> wants to thank her.

  Yennefer asks,

  <break strength="medium" />
  <voice name="en-GB-Wavenet-F">
    "What do you want for dinner?"
  </voice>
  <break strength="weak" />

  <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæs.kjɜː">Jaskier</phoneme> smiles blithely, at last resting on his haunches, and
  suggests,
  <break strength="weak" />"Pizza?"
</speak>
